A simple a simple [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) web app to test individual keys on the attached keyboard. Attaching to the [keydown](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeydown.asp) and	[keypress](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeypress.asp) [events](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp), the program waits for a key to be pressed on an attached keyboard.  If the key is working, the keydown event listener will fire an alert box containing the keycode of the key pressed; meanwhile, the keypress event fires a second alert box indicating the character being input.

**Note**: *The keycode of the physical key and the keycode of the input character are not necessarily the same.  See the help text within keyboardTester.html for further details as to why this is the case.
